        The first generation of stars
      </h1>
      <p>We think that the universe started 13 or 14 billion years ago, with the Big Bang. At that point only the lightest elements existed, such as hydrogen, helium and minuscule amounts of lithium.</p>

      <p>Elements are matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. On the periodic table, each element is distinguished by its atomic number, which describes the number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms.</p>
        
      <p> The first generation of stars formed as lumps of gas drew together and eventually began to combust. This would cause a nuclear reaction in the centre of a star.</p>
        
      <p> The first stars that formed after the Big Bang were greater than 50 times the size of our Sun.</p>
        
      <p>'Inside stars a process takes place called nucleosynthesis, which is basically the making of elements,' Ashley says. 'The bigger the star, the faster they burn their fuel.'</p>
        
      <p>The first stars burned their fuel quickly and were able to make only a few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. When those stars went supernova and expelled the elements they had produced, they seeded the next generation of stars.</p>
        
      <p>Scientists can tell the temperature and age of stars from their colour. Hotter stars burn blue, while cooler and older stars burn red.</p>

     <h1>
      So are we really made of stardust?
     </h1>
      Most of the elements of our bodies were formed in stars over the course of billions of years and multiple star lifetimes.
    </p>
      However, it's also possible that some of our hydrogen (which makes up roughly 9.5% of our bodies) and lithium, which our body contains in very tiny trace amounts, originated from the Big Bang.
